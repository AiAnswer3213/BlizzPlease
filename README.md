# BlizzPlease v1.0
ðŸš€ Groundbreaking Technology Unveiled After 20 Years in the Making! After two decades of intense research and development, we've harnessed cutting-edge technology and pioneered advanced algorithms, in conjunction with the latest AI advancements, to solve the most pressing issues. Presenting: BlizzPlease.

## âœ¨ Groundbreaking Features âœ¨
- Perfectly Aligned Raid Info Panel: The text in the Raid Info tab, displaying instance save IDs, no longer clips on the left side. The indentations are as originally envisioned, but less clippy

- Harmonized Title Alignments: The talents frame title text is now positioned smack-dab in the middle of the header bar, the quest log frame title is no longer attempting to escape its frame, and the spellbook frame title is perfectly aligned with the header bar. Experience flawless symmetry across your UI.

- Persistent Interface Options: The Show Cloak and Show Helm settings now stop resetting unexpectedly on cancel.
